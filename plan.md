- Ensure the application has a standardized configuration process that allows it to run consistently across different environments (e.g., local, staging, and production).
- Implement a validation mechanism to verify that the application and all its core features are fully operational immediately after the deployment process.
- Establish a graceful error-handling system that prevents the application from crashing and provides user-friendly feedback during unexpected failures.
- Define a clear and repeatable startup sequence that ensures all necessary background services and components are initialized before the user interacts with the site.
- Verify that all external integrations and data connections are correctly linked and functional to prevent "broken" states upon initial launch.
